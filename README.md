# Visual-Studio-Power-Mode
An extension that attempts to clone the power mode in Atom found here : https://atom.io/packages/activate-power-mode  
Feel free to fork and submit pull requests, I'm excited to see what we can add.  
Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to get the current text colour so for now it is just customizable. 


Settings can be found in the Tools > options > Power Mode menu.  

##1.1.4 Release Notes  
Added VS 2012/13 support  
Added ability to get color from environment

###Known Issues  
Settings don't load when visual studio is opened, working on it.  For now, just open and close options.

Thanks to Parnic for his work and providing the build
